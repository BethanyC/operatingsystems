Notes:

1. Everything you need is in "source"

2. Each lecture is organized as follows:
   - top-level restructured text file kept directly in source (e.g. ipc.rst)
   - all examples should be kept in a subdirectory with a matching name
     e.g. ipc.rst references diagrams and code in ipc/diagrams and ipc/code,
     all of which are under source. This keeps each lecture somewhat self
     contained but supports the use case of being able to edit any lecture
     quickly.

   - I recommend using includeliteral for extensive examples. You'll notice
     this, especially in the ipc.rst lecture. There are also examples of
     how to include figures and tables. (I have found rst's CSV tables to
     be quite slick and a huge time saver.)

3. Building is done from the top-level
   - make sure you have Python setup on your computer and Sphinx. If you
     set up Python on Windows or Ubuntu, you will need the setuptools and
     should be able to run "easy_install -U sphinx". It is pretty much
     a no-brainer

   - make targets
     latexpdf -> creates PDF book of our lectures by way of LaTeX (which must
       therefore be installed.
     html -> creates a beautiful site from our lectures
     epub -> creates an eBook for your e-reading device

   - all targets are created in build. I should probably put this directory
     in .gitignore. Be careful not to add it by mistake for now.
